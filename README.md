# xipho_ARGs_project
Repository for files, scripts, and ARG tutorial associated with manuscript on Xiphorhynchus spixii

# Notes

- For quick accessibility, I have added relatively small files (scripts, some input files, step-by-step notes, some output files, etc.) to this repository. 
- This set of files is a subset of all the files available on Dryad.
- Files only found on Dryad include: all VCF files, reference genomes, ARGweaver input .bed files, ARGweaver output SMC.gz and log files, and RAiSD output.
